    <p><em>I'm vegan because it makes sense.</em></p>

    <p>Veganism is an ideology that rejects the commodification/exploitation of animals in an effort to
     extend moral consideration to all sentient beings. This involves abstaining from the consumption of 
     animal-based products and services in any form, including food, clothing, entertainment, or anything else. 
     Sentience is the key characteristic that differentiates animals from plants. It is the ability to experience 
     feelings and sensations, including the capacity to suffer. All sentient beings are individuals!
     </p>

     <p>Speciesism is the assumption of human superiority leading to the exploitation of animals. We already recognize
      that humans deserve moral consideration in the form of rights protecting us from unjustified violence. 
      No matter how different one human is from another, we should all be able live in peace, free from actions 
      that violate our rights. With this in mind, animals are often used, abused, and killed by humans due to 
      flawed logic claiming that certain differences they possess (traits) allows us to disregard them as 
      individuals and prevent the extension of legal rights to them. Other animals should be granted legal rights! 
      The same logic and reasoning is used to justify homophobia, racism, sexism, and all other forms of bigotry 
      and discrimination.

    <p>Following a vegan lifestyle since March of 2017, I advocate for veganism by having conversations with 
        individuals on the street about the vegan ideology. My goal is to educate and create a space for individuals
        to understand veganism and how it aligns with their values if they already reject animal abuse, oppression 
        and exploitation!</p> 

    <p>Please take the time to watch my activism videos, and if you find this kind of education interesting you can 
        subscribe to my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@logicalconsistency/videos" target="_blank"

    <p>If you are reading this and are not already vegan, I hope you take the time to listen to the arguments for 
        veganism and if possible, talk to a vegan directly. My door is always open if you want to have an open conversation 
        about veganism via my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/logicalconsistency/" target="_blank"
